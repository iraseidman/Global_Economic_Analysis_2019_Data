## Problem Statement
This analysis compares how many, though not all for simplicity's sake, of the major world economies compare to each other on four dimensions - population, work force participation, average hours worked per year, and real GDP in 2017 dollars with over 70 years of data between 1950 to 2019. The data comes from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands and there are additional columns that are created using a combination of the given columns - GDP pr capita and GDP per capita per hour worked.

## Executive Summary

This analysis was inspired by a six month trip I am finished at the beginning of 2023 through Israel, Egypt, and Europe along the Mediterranean and Alps. I am looking to see how opportunity in each of these countries and beyond compares to opportunity in the United States, with an ultimate goal of seeing which countries have the strongest economies by measure of their GDP per capita against the average hours worked by members of the work force.

## Analysis

This analysis showed impressive results from a number of countries including: excellent work force participation from Luxembourg and Singapore, high human capital indices from Singapore, Israel, and Slovakia, extended time-off (Germany, Holland, and Iceland leading the way) and strong GDP per capita (Ireland and Luxembourg, both also very small countries and Ireland might be benefitting from being an international tax haven rather than having quite so strong of an economy). Luxembourg, Ireland, and Norway also rank the top three for strongest GDP per hour worked which is very impressive and might be an indicator for which models to look further into.

### Conclusions and Recommendations

There are many strong economies throughout Europe, North America, and Asia that score well on a variety of different metrics. For this analysis, the most impressive results come from Luxembourg, Ireland, and Norway which have the best GDP per capita per hour worked each year.
